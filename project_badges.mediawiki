== FIWARE Project Badges ==

This document is a recommendation on the usage of badges in FIWARE Projects. Badges are small graphical labels which
provide a visual aid to understand different aspects about a project. Badges can be easily generated by using [http://shields.io/ Shields.io]

This recommendation describes two kind of guidelines for badges: ''MUST'' (mandatory), ''SHOULD'' (desirable) and ''MAY'' (optional).

Github repositories README.md '''MUST''' include the following badges at the very beginning of the document: 

* ''FIWARE Chapter'' (Pointer to  https://www.fiware.org/developers/catalogue/  )
* ''License'' (Pointer to the OSS License under the component is offered)
* ''Documentation'' (pointer to the documentation on readthedocs corresponding to the branch)
* ''Docker'' (pointer to the Docker container at the Docker Hub Repository)
* ''Support'' (pointer to the support channel, stackoverflow, askbot, which can be used to get support). 

The repository's mandatory README.md badges MUST appear in the following order:

* ''FIWARE Chapter''
* ''License''
* ''Documentation'' 
* ''Docker''
* ''Support''

Github repositories '''SHOULD''' include the following badges: 

* ''Build Status'' (pointer to the result of the CI process) 
* ''Coverage'' (Status of code coverage provided by tests)

Github repositories '''MAY''' include, among others, badges for: 

* Information about mandatory runtimes and versions to run the project (node, npm, python, pypi, etc.) 
* Any badge relevant specifically for the project.

For MUST badges please see the following examples (that you will have to accommodate to your particular case):

* FIWARE Chapter: https://img.shields.io/badge/FIWARE-Core_Context-233c68.svg - see below for color scheme.

* License: https://img.shields.io/badge/license-AGPL-blue.svg

* Documentation: https://readthedocs.org/projects/fiware-orion/badge/?version=latest

* Docker: https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/fiware/orion.svg

* Support: https://img.shields.io/badge/support-askbot-yellowgreen.svg, https://img.shields.io/badge/support-sof-yellowgreen.svg
